# Eager No UI Example App

This is an example app for [Eager](https://eager.io).

The app modifies the background color of websites in an amusing, if useless,
way.  To try it out download this project to your computer, and open the folder
in the [App Tester](https://eager.io/developer/app-tester).

It is an example of an app which doesnâ€™t add any UI to the page, but instead just
adds some JavaScript and CSS.  For more information about Eager and developing
apps, please visit the [developer docs](https://eager.io/developer/docs).

As always, you can contact us at [developer-help@eager.io](mailto:developer-help@eager.io)
with any questions or concerns.
